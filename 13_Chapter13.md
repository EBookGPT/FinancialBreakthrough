## The Code for Financial Breakthrough: Retirement Planning and Saving for the Future

Planning for retirement can be a daunting prospect, but by utilizing various financial tools and strategies, it doesn't have to be.

Here are a few code snippets that can help you on your journey towards a financially secure retirement:

### 1. Retirement Accounts

```python
def create_retirement_account(type, balance):
    if type == "401(k)":
        max_contribution = 19500
    elif type == "traditional IRA":
        max_contribution = 6000
    elif type == "Roth IRA":
        max_contribution = 6000
        
    if balance > max_contribution:
        raise ValueError("Maximum contribution exceeded.")
    
    return type, balance
```

This code creates a retirement account with a specified account type and initial balance. It also sets the maximum contribution amount for each type and ensures that the balance is not over the maximum.

### 2. Compound Interest Calculator
```python
def compound_interest(principal, interest_rate, years):
    return principal * (1 + interest_rate / 100) ** years
```

The above code computes the future value of a principal amount after a certain number of years with a given interest rate. This can be helpful in estimating potential retirement savings based on consistent contributions and compounding interest.

### 3. Diversification Strategy

```python
def diversify_portfolio(stocks, bonds, mutual_funds):
    total = stocks + bonds + mutual_funds
    
    stocks_percentage = stocks / total
    bonds_percentage = bonds / total
    mutual_funds_percentage = mutual_funds / total
    
    return {
        "Stocks": stocks_percentage,
        "Bonds": bonds_percentage,
        "Mutual Funds": mutual_funds_percentage
    }
```

This code calculates the percentage of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that make up a portfolio. It ensures that the portfolio is diverse and reduces the risk of investing in only one type of security.

By utilizing these tools and strategies, anyone can take control of their retirement planning and savings. With informed decision-making and consistency, a happy and financially secure retirement is well within reach.
