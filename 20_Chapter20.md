# Chapter 20: Achieving Long-Term Financial Success

Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight Sparkle had come a long way since they first arrived in Financial Breakthrough, California. They had battled fierce monsters and braved treacherous mazes in order to unlock the secrets of financial breakthrough. But there was one challenge that still lay ahead - achieving long-term financial success.

As they walked through the bustling streets of Financial Breakthrough, they noticed a strange rabbit hopping towards them. It was wearing a waistcoat, and carried a pocket watch. The rabbit stopped in front of them, and looked up at Twilight with beady, red eyes.

"You're late, you're late, for a very important date!" the rabbit exclaimed.

Twilight was taken aback. "What date? What are you talking about?"

"The date you're going to achieve long-term financial success!" the rabbit replied. "Hurry, hurry, follow me!"

With that, the rabbit hopped away, and the group followed. They ran through twisting alleys and dark tunnels, until they arrived at a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a large pit, deep and black. The rabbit turned to Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight.

"This is the pit of temptation," it said. "Many have fallen into it, never to emerge. But if you can resist the lure of temptation, you will achieve long-term financial success."

Sonic stepped forward, his eyes fixed on the pit. He felt a pull, a desire to dive into the pit, to feel the thrill of instant gratification. Vanellope looked away, afraid of the darkness within the pit. And Twilight closed her eyes, focusing on her breath.

Slowly, the pull faded, and Sonic stepped back. "I won't succumb to temptation," he said quietly.

"Nor I," said Vanellope firmly.

Twilight opened her eyes, and looked down at the pit. "I will resist temptation," she said. "I will focus on my long-term goals, and not be distracted by short-term gains."

The rabbit smiled, and clapped its paws together. "Well done," it said. "You have proved yourselves worthy of achieving long-term financial success. Now, let me show you the way."

The rabbit led them out of the clearing, and into a bright, open field. There, they encountered the Cheshire Cat, grinning broadly.

"Welcome to the world of long-term financial success," said the cat. "To achieve it, you must stay focused, stay disciplined, and stay true to your goals. And when in doubt, remember - with patience and perseverance, all things are possible."

Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight nodded, determined to reach their goals. They had come this far, and they knew they could go even further. For they had learned that achieving true financial breakthrough wasn't just about quick fixes and instant success - it was about building long-term wealth, and enjoying the fruits of their labor for years to come.

Code Sample:

```
def resist_temptation(balance, temptation):
    if temptation > balance:
        return "Sorry, you don't have enough balance to give in to temptation."
    else:
        return "Good job! You've resisted temptation and maintained your balance."
```
The `resist_temptation` function used in the Alice in Wonderland trippy story is a simple Python function that takes in two parameters - `balance` and `temptation`. 

The `balance` parameter represents the amount of money or resources that the character has available to them. The `temptation` parameter represents the amount of short-term gain or pleasure that the character is considering, which could potentially harm their long-term financial success.

The function checks to see if the `temptation` value is greater than the `balance` value. If it is, the function will return a message indicating that the character does not have enough balance to give into temptation. However, if the `balance` value is greater than or equal to the `temptation` value, the function will return a message indicating that the character successfully resisted temptation and maintained their balance.

This code is meant to demonstrate the importance of resisting the temptation to make short-term financial decisions that could impede long-term financial success. It is important to make financial decisions with a clear and level head, and to prioritize long-term goals over short-term gains.
