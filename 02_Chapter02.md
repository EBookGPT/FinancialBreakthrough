# Chapter 2: Starting with Small Savings - An Alice in Wonderland Trippy Story

Sonic the Hedgehog, Vanellope von Schweetz and Twilight Sparkle found themselves in a peculiar place. They were in a garden filled with talking flowers and strange creatures of all shapes and sizes. As they explored the garden, they came across a small table with a sign that read "Tea Party for Small Savers."

Curious and intrigued, they sat down at the table and were greeted by the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. They were discussing the importance of saving and setting financial goals.

The Mad Hatter had a pot of tea, and he asked Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight Sparkle, "Would you like some tea?"

They replied, "Yes please."

But the Mad Hatter poured the tea into cups with holes at the bottom, which spilled onto the table.

"Mad Hatter, why would you do that?" Vanellope asked.

"Because, my dear, that's how it is with money. If you don't save it, you'll never have it," the Mad Hatter replied.

Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight Sparkle learned then the importance of small savings. They realized that every penny counted and that they needed to start saving regularly to achieve their financial goals.

As the tea party came to a close, the March Hare handed each of them a small bag of gold coins, saying, "Remember, every success story starts with small savings."

With newfound knowledge and motivation, they left the whimsical tea party and embarked on their journey to financial stability through small savings.

And so, Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight Sparkle learned that even in a trippy world like Wonderland, financial breakthroughs can be achieved through something as simple as small savings.
# Code Explanation

In the Alice in Wonderland trippy story, Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight Sparkle learn the importance of small savings from the Mad Hatter and March Hare at a tea party. So, let's break down the code you can use to achieve small savings in your own life:

```
income = 5000
expenses = 4500
savings_goal = 10000

#Calculate monthly savings
monthly_savings = (income - expenses) * 0.10

#Calculate months to reach savings goal
months_to_reach_goals = savings_goal / monthly_savings

print("Your monthly savings: $", monthly_savings)
print("Months to reach savings goal:", months_to_reach_goals)
```

In the above code, we first define our income, expenses, and savings_goal variables.

We then calculate our monthly savings by subtracting our expenses from our income and multiplying the result by 0.10 (representing 10%). This represents the amount of money saved each month towards the savings goal.

Next, we calculate the number of months it will take to reach our savings goal by dividing our savings goal by our monthly savings.

Lastly, we print out the calculated monthly savings and the number of months to reach the savings goal.

By saving a small percentage of your income every month, you can eventually reach your savings goal. It's simple, but it takes discipline and determination.

So, buckle up for the journey ahead and remember, every success story starts with small savings!
