# Code Implementation: Resolving the Alice in Wonderland Trippy Story

In the Alice in Wonderland trippy story, Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight Sparkle, along with their special guest Ramit Sethi, embark on a journey of self-discovery to uncover their relationship with money. Along the way, they must confront their fears and limiting beliefs, which are preventing them from achieving financial breakthroughs.

To resolve this story, we need to implement code that can help us overcome our own limiting beliefs and guide us towards achieving our financial goals. Here are a few examples of the code we can use:

## Exercise 1: Identifying Limiting Beliefs
```
let limitingBeliefs = ['I will never have enough money', 'I can never be good with money', 'Money is evil', 'I am not worthy of financial success'];
for (let belief of limitingBeliefs) {
    console.log(`My limiting belief: ${belief}`);
}
```
This code allows us to identify our limiting beliefs and write them down, helping us to recognize and overcome them.

## Exercise 2: Developing a Positive Money Mindset
```
let positiveAffirmations = ['I am capable of achieving financial success', 'Money comes to me easily and abundantly', 'I deserve to be financially free'];
for (let affirmation of positiveAffirmations) {
    console.log(`My positive affirmation: ${affirmation}`);
}
```
This code allows us to develop a positive money mindset by identifying and affirming our beliefs in abundance and financial success.

## Exercise 3: Aligning Spending and Saving Habits with Financial Goals
```
let monthlyIncome = 5000;
let monthlyExpenses = 3000;
let monthlySavings = monthlyIncome - monthlyExpenses;
console.log(`My monthly savings: ${monthlySavings}`);
```
This code helps us align our spending and saving habits with our financial goals by calculating our monthly savings and identifying areas where we can cut back on expenses.

By implementing these three exercises, among others, we can constantly work on our mindset and habits, overcome our limiting beliefs, and achieve financial breakthroughs.

So let's take these lessons from our journey through the surreal world of Alice in Wonderland and apply them to our own lives. Remember, financial breakthrough is not just about money - it's about understanding ourselves, identifying our limiting beliefs, and taking positive steps towards financial success.
