# The Financial Wonderland: Creating a Budget that Works

Once upon a time in the land of Financial Breakthrough, Sonic the Hedgehog, Vanellope von Schweetz and Twilight Sparkle stumbled upon a strange rabbit hole. They hesitantly peered inside, and before they knew it, they fell right into it!

As they plunged into the hole, they found themselves in a magical world filled with mysterious doors and whimsical creatures. They soon met a wise old budgeting caterpillar named Cato, who encouraged them to join him for a discussion of budgeting.

Cato explained to the trio the importance of setting a budgeting goal and monitoring their income and expenses to ensure they are matching. He taught them about the 50/30/20 rule, and the cash envelope system as powerful tools they can use for budget management. Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight were fascinated by Cato's knowledge, and eager to learn more.

Further down the rabbit hole, they encountered the mysterious Cheshire Cat, who introduced them to budgeting apps as a modern and easy-to-use budgeting solution. The team learned about apps that can help them monitor their expenses on a daily basis and give them up-to-date alerts on when they are going over budget.

As they journeyed through the Financial Wonderland, they entered a strange tea party hosted by the Mad Hatter. There they learned some valuable lessons about the dangers of overspending and how to control their impulses to avoid frivolous expenses.

In the end, Sonic, Vanellope, and Twilight realized that creating a budget that works is all about setting achievable goals, monitoring expenses, and being vigilant of overspending. They had learned how to get control of their financial life, and they emerged from this bizarre journey more confident and empowered than ever before.

And so, the trio set out to spread the word and share this financial wisdom with the rest of Financial Breakthrough. The end.
# Resolving the Alice in Wonderland Trippy Story - The Code

Now, let's delve into the technical side of the Alice in Wonderland trippy story and see how the code can help us create a budget that works towards our Financial Breakthrough.

**1. Setting Financial Goals**
```python
income = 5000
expenses = 3000
savings_goal_percentage = 20
savings_goal_amount = (income - expenses) * savings_goal_percentage / 100
```
Setting financial goals is the cornerstone of budgeting. Above, we see an example in Python of how to set savings goal. Income is set to 5000 dollars, expenses at 3000 dollars, and we want to save 20% of the difference. Our code does this calculation for us, resulting in a savings goal of 400 dollars.

**2. Evaluating Income and Expenses**
```javascript
let total_income = 0;
let total_expenses = 0;

income.forEach(function (element) {
    total_income += element.amount;
});

expenses.forEach(function (element) {
    total_expenses += element.amount;
});
```
In the above example, we see an implementation in JavaScript of how to evaluate income and expenses. We start with initializing two variables to 0, one for total income and one for total expenses. Then, we use loops in order to iterate over every element of the respective arrays and add up their amounts. 

**3. Figuring Out How Much You Can Afford to Save**
```csharp
decimal net_income = gross_income - (federal_tax + state_tax + social_security_tax);
decimal total_expenses = rent + utilities + transportation + food + entertainment;
decimal savings_goal_percentage = 20;
decimal savings_goal_amount = (net_income - total_expenses) * savings_goal_percentage / 100;
```
Determining what you can afford to save is crucial for your goal attainment. This code sample in C# computes your disposable income after tax and examines how much you spend to determine how much you can save. It then uses the savings goal percentage we set earlier and calculates the savings goal amount.

**4. Budgeting Strategies and Tools**
```ruby
budget = income - expenses
savings = income * 0.2
expenses_by_category = expenses.group_by { |e| e.category }

expenses_by_category.each do |category, expenses|
  category_total = expenses.sum { |e| e.amount }
  category_percentage = category_total / budget * 100
end
```
Here, we have an implementation in Ruby that showcases how to use the budget and savings goals we have made earlier and puts them into motion with expenses. We then use the expenses_by_category variable to group expenses together so that they can be budgeted more effectively. Lastly, we calculate the category percentage of the total budget.

By utilizing these code examples and implementing them into our budgeting process, we can take control of our financial future and achieve our Financial Breakthrough.
