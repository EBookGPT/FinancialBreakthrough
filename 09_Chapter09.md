# Code Explanation for the Alice in Wonderland Trippy Story

In the Alice in Wonderland trippy story on increasing your income streams, there were a few notable instances of code that were utilized to help the characters achieve their financial breakthrough. Let's take a closer look at the different pieces of code used and explain how they helped to resolve the story.

## 1. Diversification

One of the key themes in the story is the importance of diversifying your income streams. This can be achieved by investing in a variety of different assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates the concept of diversification:

```
portfolio = {'stocks': 50, 'bonds': 30, 'real estate': 20}

total_value = 0
for asset, value in portfolio.items():
    # calculate the total value of the portfolio
    total_value += value

for asset, value in portfolio.items():
    # calculate the percentage weight of each asset
    weight = value / total_value * 100
    print(f"{asset}: {weight}%")
```

This code creates a dictionary (portfolio) that holds the values for different assets. It then calculates the total value of the portfolio and uses that value to calculate the percentage weight of each asset. The output is a breakdown of the portfolio's distribution.

## 2. Identifying the Best Income Streams

Another important aspect of the story is identifying the best income streams for your skills and interests. Here is some sample code that can help with this:

```
skills = {'writing': 8, 'photography': 5, 'programming': 9, 'cooking': 4}

# sort skills by value (skill level) in descending order
sorted_skills = sorted(skills.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

for skill, value in sorted_skills:
    print(f"{skill.capitalize()}: {value}/10")
```

This code creates a dictionary (skills) that holds values for different skills, such as writing or programming. It then sorts the skills by their value and prints out a list of the skills in descending order, with their respective values.

## 3. Balancing Income Streams

A crucial element in the story is ensuring that your income streams are balanced and sustainable over the long term. Here is some sample code that can help with this:

```
income = {'job': 3000, 'side hustle': 500, 'dividends': 100}

# calculate the total income
total_income = sum(income.values())

for stream, value in income.items():
    # calculate the percentage weight of each income stream
    weight = value / total_income * 100
    # print out the breakdown of income streams
    print(f"{stream.capitalize()}: {weight}%")
```

This code creates a dictionary (income) that holds values for different income streams, such as a job or dividends. It then calculates the total income and uses that to calculate the percentage weight of each income stream. The output is a breakdown of the income streams.

By utilizing code like the examples above, you can increase your understanding of the different methods for increasing your income streams and make strategic decisions that will lead to your financial breakthrough.
